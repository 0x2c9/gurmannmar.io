# How to Implement Nuxt Content

Nuxt Content is a Git-based headless CMS that allows you to write in a content/ directory and fetch your Markdown, JSON, and YAML files through a MongoDB-like API. It's a powerful tool that can be used to create a blog, documentation, or any other type of website.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement Nuxt Content in a Nuxt.js application. We will create a blog using Nuxt Content and display the blog posts on the home page.

## 1. Create a new Nuxt.js application

First, we need to create a new Nuxt.js application. If you don't have Nuxt.js installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
npx create-nuxt-app nuxt-content-blog
```

After running the command, you will be prompted to answer a few questions to set up your Nuxt.js application. Once the setup is complete, you can navigate to the newly created directory and start the development server using the following command:

```bash
cd nuxt-content-blog
npm run dev
```

## 2. Install Nuxt Content

Next, we need to install Nuxt Content in our Nuxt.js application. You can install Nuxt Content using the following command:

```bash
npm install @nuxt/content
```

After installing Nuxt Content, we need to add it to the `modules` section of the `nuxt.config.js` file:

```javascript
// nuxt.config.js

export default {
	// ...
	modules: [
		'@nuxt/content'
	],
	// ...
}
```

## 3. Create a new blog post

To create a new blog post, you need to create a new file in the `content` directory. The file should be named `your-blog-post-title.md`. For example, if you want to create a blog post with the title `how-to-implement-nuxt-content`, you need to create a file named `how-to-implement-nuxt-content.md` in the `content` directory.

The content of the file should be written in Markdown format. Here's an example of a blog post file:
